<h2>What is Version Control?</h2>
    <p>
      Version Control Systems (VCS) track changes to files and enable collaboration on software projects. 
      They maintain history, support rollback, and allow multiple developers to work together efficiently.
    </p>

    <h3>Centralized vs. Distributed Models</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Centralized VCS (CVCS):</strong> One central server stores the official code (e.g., CVS, Subversion).</li>
      <li><strong>Distributed VCS (DVCS):</strong> Every user has a full copy of the repository (e.g., Git, Mercurial).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Distributed systems revolutionized collaboration by enabling offline work, better branching and merging,
      and flexible workflows. Git, created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, is now the de facto standard.
