    <h3>Why Distributed VCS Changed Everything</h3>
    <p>
      Distributed systems like Git removed dependency on a single central server, improving speed,
      resilience, and collaboration. Each user’s repository acts as a backup, and merging/branching 
      became central to modern workflows.
