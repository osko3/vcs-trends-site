  <h1>Key Milestones in VCS History</h1>

  <p>Version control has evolved significantly over the past few decades. Below is a brief timeline of major systems that shaped its development:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>RCS</strong> (1982): One of the earliest systems for managing revisions on single files.</li>
    <li><strong>CVS</strong> (1990): Introduced collaboration features for teams, but lacked good branching support.</li>
    <li><strong>Subversion (SVN)</strong> (2000): Improved over CVS with better support for directories and branching.</li>
    <li><strong>Git</strong> (2005): Created by Linus Torvalds; fully distributed and highly performant.</li>
    <li><strong>Mercurial</strong> (2005): Similar to Git, with a focus on simplicity and usability.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The move from centralized to distributed systems transformed the way teams work together on code.</p>
